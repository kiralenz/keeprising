# keeprising

Creating a local streamlit web app for sourdough monitoring. 

## Setup
Use the pipenv file to create a pipenv?
Or the conda environment yaml?

## Usage
At the moment:
1. run the dummy_data_creation notebook to reset the data to its original form and save it to the local file
2. run the chart creation notebook to add the "latest" data and save it to the local file
3. create the conda environment
4. go to the folder where everything is stored (local)
5. streamlit run keeprising.py
Voila.
